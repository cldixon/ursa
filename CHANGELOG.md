## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `scan_edges` and `scan_nodes` now return rows in file order on every run.
  A file large enough to be read as several parallel partitions previously
  came back in a run-dependent order, so dense ids, component labels,
  `edge_ids` and PageRank's last bits changed between runs over the same
  file. Output over a scan now matches `from_arrow` over the same table
  exactly (#148).
- `scan_edges` and `scan_nodes` over a Parquet file with string ids failed
  with "Utf8View is not a supported id type". DataFusion reads Parquet
  strings as `Utf8View`; string ids are now canonicalized to `Utf8` like
  `LargeUtf8`. CSV and in-memory string ids were not affected.
- A kernel that asked for the lazily built transpose or undirected view from
  inside a parallel loop could deadlock, e.g. `neighbors().agg()` or `hop` with
  `direction="in"`/`"both"` on graphs above 65,536 edges.

### Changed

- Building the graph index over an unweighted `scan_edges` source no longer
  holds the scanned Arrow endpoints for the whole build. Each batch is interned
  and freed as it is decoded, inside one native call, so the 16 B/edge input
  never accumulates. On a 30M-edge Parquet file the build's peak memory fell
  from about 45 to 24 B/edge, and the footprint after the build from about 33
  to 17 B/edge, with build time unchanged (#149). Weighted scans keep the
  previous path, since their weight columns must outlive the build.
- Faster and leaner throughout; every kernel's output is unchanged unless
  noted. Timings on a 4-core machine:
  - Index build: known ids are interned in parallel, and scans read 128K-row
    batches. A 30M-edge Parquet scan and build went from ~2.9s to ~1.65s;
    with 2M string ids, from ~8.5s to ~3.1s.
  - In-memory frames (`from_arrow`, `from_polars`, `EdgeFrame(...)`, ...)
    no longer keep a concatenated copy of the `src`/`dst` columns next to the
    table; they share its chunks. On 30M int edges the build went from 2.7s
    to 1.6s (27 to 22 B/edge over the table); on 20M string edges, from 6.9s
    and 71 B/edge to 1.9s and 24 B/edge.
  - String node ids are stored once, in the id column's own buffers, instead
    of about 140 B of per-id overhead. On 20M edges and 2M ids the build peak
    fell from 36 to 27 B/edge.
  - The transpose that in-direction kernels use is built straight from the
    out-CSR, without per-row endpoint arrays, so it is no longer the peak:
    35 to 30 B/edge on a 30M-edge graph.
  - `triangle_count` uses the degree-ordered forward algorithm (6–7× faster
    on skewed graphs), and `clustering_coefficient` benefits too.
  - `label_propagation` (6×) and `louvain` (3–4×) count votes and community
    weights in dense arrays instead of hash maps. Louvain's aggregation now
    sums in a fixed order rather than a randomly seeded hash map's.
  - `pagerank` divides by out-degree once per node, not per edge (1.8×).
  - Weight expressions are compiled once and evaluated per batch, and
    columns that share an expression share one evaluation.
  - Smaller items: masks built from packed bits, a bounded CSR-build
    histogram on many-core machines, and a leaner strongly-connected-components
    kernel.
- An edge mask whose length does not match the graph's edge count is rejected
  instead of silently dropping the edges past its end.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-10-08

### Added

- `ursa.datasets`: bundled graphs that load offline from the wheel (`karate`
  with faction labels, `lesmis` weighted, `florentine`, `kite`), plus
  `facebook` (SNAP ego-Facebook), downloaded on first use and cached under
  `$URSA_DATA_HOME`. `list_datasets()` returns the registry.
- Interop constructors `from_edgelist`, `from_networkx`, `nodes_from_networkx`,
  `from_numpy` and `from_scipy_sparse`. networkx, numpy and scipy remain
  optional and are imported only when the matching constructor is called.
- `group_by(*keys).agg(...)`, with `mean`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `count` and
  `n_unique` aggregations, optionally aliased or named through `agg(name=...)`.
- `join(other, on=, how=)`: an equi-join of two frames on shared key columns,
  `inner` or `left`. Distinct from the automatic attribute attach.
- `rename(mapping)` and `sample(n, seed=)` on the shared relational tail.
- Filter predicates now lower as a full algebra: string and numeric
  comparisons, boolean `&` / `|` / `~`, arithmetic, and column-to-column
  comparisons. Previously only a single `col <op> number` comparison executed.
- Graph operations over a filtered edge frame (subgraph views), and over a
  traversal result from `hop` or `shortest_path`.
- `dtype="f32"` on the float-valued kernels (`pagerank`, `closeness`,
  `betweenness`, `clustering_coefficient`) and on `neighbors().agg()`, which
  emits the result column as 32-bit float. The kernel still accumulates in f64
  and the emitted value is that result cast down, so it agrees within f32
  precision. The integer-valued kernels take no `dtype`. The default output is
  unchanged.
- `http(s)://` reads for a single hosted Parquet or CSV file.
- `on_null="drop"` on edge inputs (`EdgeFrame`, `from_arrow`, `from_edgelist`,
  `scan_edges`, `read_edges`), which filters rows with a null `src` or `dst`
  and reports the dropped count as a warning. The default remains `"error"`.
- Documentation site at <https://cldixon.github.io/ursa/>: a quickstart, one
  guide per task, a reference, a limits page, and a semantics reference that
  pins each kernel to the NetworkX call it is checked against. Every example
  on the site runs in the test suite.

### Changed

- A query naming several graph algorithms now shares work across its columns
  instead of recomputing per column. Two columns naming the same kernel with the
  same parameters run it once — including the same kernel at two output dtypes,
  since `dtype=` narrows on emit and so is not part of a computation's identity.
  Separately, `triangle_count` and `clustering_coefficient` in one
  `with_columns` now share the sorted-adjacency intersection pass they both rest
  on, where previously each ran its own; over a subgraph view they also share the
  masked undirected adjacency, which is rebuilt per use rather than cached. Values
  are unchanged and bit-identical either way.
- `rayon` is now an on-by-default feature of the `ursa-core` crate. With it
  disabled the crate compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, single-threaded, and
  `rand`'s default features — and so `getrandom` — are dropped, since the
  stochastic kernels use only seeded ChaCha streams. Serial and parallel outputs
  are bit-identical. This affects Rust consumers of `ursa-core` only: the Python
  wheels build with default features and are unchanged.
- `repr()` of a collected frame renders the head as a table with the shape,
  column names and dtypes, capped at 10 rows. It previously showed only a
  shape and a column list, which left results opaque in a REPL. The preview
  reads only the rows it displays, so its cost does not scale with row count.
- `to_polars()` raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` naming the `ursa-graph[polars]`
  extra when polars is absent, in place of a bare import error.
- The README documents installation, and the PyPI project metadata links the
  documentation site.
- `version`, `ModuleType` and `PackageNotFoundError` are no longer exposed in
  the `ursa` namespace. `__version__` and `__core_version__` are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `edges.filter(...).collect()` and `edges.distinct().collect()` return rows;
  both previously raised `NotImplementedError`.
